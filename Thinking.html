<p>I am a sullen kid, simple kid that has different characteristics</p>

<p>Anger is my main rhythm of my inner thought. Because usually I will have some fantastic imagines jump into my mind.</p>

<p>It is hard to trigger though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the educational event is the easiest thing to piss me off, and the first two quiz of my history and math are out.</p>

<p>On the edge of triggering.</p>

<p>Fury is still gathering.</p>

<p>Smiling still.</p>

<p>Explosion, bloody, fog, destruction... Yep I am a childish kid.

<p>Almost, almost...</p>

<p>"Do you need help?" A voice dragged me back from the edge.

<p>Well thats the closest one that almost makes me transform, or grow.</p>

<p>My math teacher kinda erased half of my anger during the conversation(still smiling)</p>

<p>He doesn't know I am in a weird state but ya, he wants to give me some advices.

<p>My quiz was crapped.
<p>But I didn't, but almost.</p>
