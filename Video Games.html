<p>In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions.</p>

<p>The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures, although other distinct game modes exist as well.</p>

<p>The champions and setting blend a variety of elements, including high fantasy, steampunk, folklore, and Lovecraftian horror</p>

<p>ability that cannot be activated and thus gives a perpetual bonus or effect, three normal, or 'basic', abilities, and a powerful 'ultimate' ability that can only be unlocked once the character reaches level 6.</p>

<p>A champion's full set of abilities is referred to as its 'kit'. The use of champions' abilities is limited by cooldowns and a resource (usually some form of mana or energy).</p>

<p>Each champion also has an 'auto' or 'basic attack' in which they deal damage to the target unit within range simply by right-clicking them, with no cost</p>

<p>some champions are melee and have to be closer to use their basic attack, while others are ranged, although to compensate melee champions are usually more durable.</p>

<p>The rate at which a champion can basic attack is determined by their attack speed, a stat that can be improved through items. Some champions additionally use ammo and must reload after enacting a certain number of basic attacks.</p>

<p>Champions begin every match at level one, and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18.</p>

<p>Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character.</p>

<p>If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated, but are automatically revived in their base after a 'respawn timer' ends - the timer increases in duration as the game goes on.</p>
