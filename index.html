<p>Mt. Maor was located in the Donglin Mountain Range. At the foot of Mt. Maor, there was a small village, known for its simple and rustic country life. The people here mainly relied on agriculture, as they were completely isolated from the rest of the world.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning. At the entrance of the village, all the villagers had gathered. They seemed to be sending off a boy, who was maybe fifteen or sixteen years old. The boy looked rather frail, but this was masked by his gentle demeanor. He was dressed in common blue robes that had faded from overwashing, but these robes, when coupled with his well-kept appearance, made him look smart and spirited.</p>

<p>The boy’s name was Bai Xiaochun.</p>

<p>“Family and friends, I will soon leave on my journey to cultivate immortality, but I really can’t bear to part with all of you.” The boy’s face was filled with reluctance, as his polite speech left people with an even deeper impression of his innocence. </p>

<p>Around him, the villagers looked anxiously at each other. None of them wanted to let this young man leave either.</p>

<p>“Xiaochun, your parents passed away too early... You’re really such a good child! Don’t you want to live an immortal life anymore? If you become an immortal, you’ll live for a very, very long time. Go! Every chick must leave their nest and fly away someday.” A gray-haired old man said, as he walked out of the crowd. When he called Xiaochun a good child, he briefly paused. </p>

<p>“Once you’re on the outside, no matter how difficult the circumstances are, you must persevere! Move on and hold your head high! Once you walk out of this village, you should never turn back, because your future lies in front of you.” The old man kindly shared his wisdom, as he clapped the boy on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Immortality…” Bai Xiaochun straightened his shoulders, as determination started to appear in his eyes. Under the encouraging gazes of the old man and the surrounding villagers, he nodded his head resolutely. He took a last good look at all of his friends and family who surrounded him, before he turned and then resolutely strode out of his village.</p>

<p>As the boy’s figure disappeared into the distance, one by one, the villagers became wrought by emotions. Their sad expresssions were replaced by happy and joyful ones. Even the kind-hearted and gracious old man was trembling all over, as even tears started rolling down his wrinkled face. </p>

<p>“Bless the heavens! That bastard has finally… Finally left our village! Whoever told him that an immortal has been seen in this area, you’ve helped our village take a giant leap forward!</p>

<p>“That bastard finally left! My poor chickens… What a pity! just because he hated the crowing, that bastard used some sneaky method to instigate a group of children to eat every last chicken in this village.”</p>

<p>“Today is the start of a new year!” From the small village, the sounds of loud cheering emanated. Someone had even brought out their drums and happily drummed away.</p>

<p>Outside of the village walls, Bai Xiaochun had not yet walked very far, before he heard the sound of drums and wild cheers coming from the direction of the village.</p>
