<p>JubyPhonic (aka Juliet Simmons) is a YouTube artist and professional voice actress/ vocalist.</p>

<p>Sometimes going by Juby, she is a fairly new and popular YouTube singer who started singing end of May 2012.</p>

<p>She records mostly English covers of VOCALOID and anime songs, with her own translyrics.</p>

<p>Besides recording cover vocals and writing her own translyrics/ lyrics, Juby also often provides her own subs for her English covers, does some of the artwork for her site and covers, mixes audio and edits video.</p>

<p>When time allows, she enjoys collaborating on original projects and re-mixes with other artists, composers and musicians.</p>

<p>Her voice has a characteristic stability, clarity, and brilliance along with a certain bounce to it.</p>

<p>She is also known for being emotionally expressive and touching her fans' hearts.</p>

<p>Something unique about Juby is that she is able to bring her musical theater and voice over acting experience to each song's story and "become" the person in her covers.</p>

<p>Performing as the character in the song's story, at times her singing voice and mixing may vary to suit the character or the different vocal styles of the songs.</p>

<p>More than 50 of her covers have over one million views (Aug. 2017). A few of her most popular English covers to date: "Drop Pop Candy" (9.6M views), "Game of Life", (6.6M), "Lost One's Weeping" (6M), Childish War (4.6M), Witch Hunt (4.3M), Echo (4.3M), Wildfire (3.6M), World is Mine (3.6M), Rolling Girl (3.3M) Bad Apple (3.3M), Death Should Not Have Taken Thee (3.1M), Remote Control (3.1M).</p>

<p>She supports her fan's creative expression and all new creative works in general, thus her translyrics and covers are available for use as long as she (and the original work) is properly credited and used in projects for fun (non profit).</p>
